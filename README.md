# Disk Usage

This program calculates and displays the total space used for a directory, its files, and all of its subdirectories. I wrote it because I didn't like any of the free ones I found on the net, and I wasn't about to spend money for a little utility like this. DiskUsage doesn't require an installer, so it's easy to run on any modern Windows system.

This software is charityware.  If you like it and use it, I ask that you donate something to the charity of your choice.  I'll never know if you follow this policy, but the good karma from following it will be well worth your investment.
